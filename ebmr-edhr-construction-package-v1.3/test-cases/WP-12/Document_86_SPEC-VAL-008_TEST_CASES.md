# Test Cases — Document 86: Infrastructure, Cloud, Platform & Environment Qualification (SPEC-VAL-008)

**Work package:** WP-12  
**Risk class:** HIGHER-PROCESS-RISK  
**Requirements covered:** INFQ-FR-001..020 (20)  
**Test cases:** 49  
**Code location:** `validation`  
**Authoritative store:** PostgreSQL (GxP Core, authoritative)

Execution rules: run cases in listed order; a case with `depends_on` runs after its parent; record actual result and evidence for every case; a failed case is evidence and is never re-run over or edited to pass — raise a defect and reference it.

| Status values | meaning |
|---|---|
| NOT_STARTED | not yet executed |
| IN_PROGRESS | executing |
| PASS | executed, expected result observed, evidence captured |
| FAIL | executed, expected result not observed; defect raised |
| BLOCKED | cannot execute; blocker recorded |
| N/A | not applicable, with recorded justification |
