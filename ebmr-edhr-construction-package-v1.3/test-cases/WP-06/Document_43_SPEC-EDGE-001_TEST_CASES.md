# Test Cases — Document 43: Edge Gateway Runtime Architecture & Construction Specification (SPEC-EDGE-001)

**Work package:** WP-06  
**Risk class:** HIGHER-PROCESS-RISK  
**Requirements covered:** EDGE-FR-001..030 (30)  
**Test cases:** 115  
**Code location:** `edge`  
**Authoritative store:** Edge local store (buffered, pre-authoritative) → PostgreSQL on acceptance

Execution rules: run cases in listed order; a case with `depends_on` runs after its parent; record actual result and evidence for every case; a failed case is evidence and is never re-run over or edited to pass — raise a defect and reference it.

| Status values | meaning |
|---|---|
| NOT_STARTED | not yet executed |
| IN_PROGRESS | executing |
| PASS | executed, expected result observed, evidence captured |
| FAIL | executed, expected result not observed; defect raised |
| BLOCKED | cannot execute; blocker recorded |
| N/A | not applicable, with recorded justification |

- **Type / priority:** positive / P1
- **Automation:** integration | **Qualification stage:** OQ
- **Preconditions:** Tenant and site fixtures loaded; actor holds the role and current qualification required for this action; module aggregate in a valid starting state.
- **Test data:** Minimum valid data set for module aggregate; actor with required role/qualification.
- **Steps:** 1. Load the fixture data listed in test_data. | 2. Authenticate as the qualified actor for this action. | 3.
